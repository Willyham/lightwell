# Performance measurement plan

Status: provisional budgets, not accepted requirements. The owner's M4 MacBook Pro is the reference machine. The engineering rules every core and desktop change must follow are in [performance rules](../engineering/performance-rules.md). Fast interaction, background throughput and output correctness are evaluated separately.

## Reference workloads

| Workload | What it reveals |
| --- | --- |
| 24 MP and 60 MP JPEGs, EXIF-rotated variants, embedded sRGB/Adobe RGB/Display P3 profiles | First-open latency, memory, geometry and color |
| Huge or invalid dimensions, truncated files, malformed profiles | Resource bounds and error recovery |
| M4 with its actual display scale recorded; optional external SDR 4K | Preview, input, color, DPI and Metal resource measurements |
| Linux ARM64 VM, later native Windows/Linux GPU machines | Functional portability versus native GPU behavior, measured separately |
| 100,000 metadata rows; 1,000,000-row stress catalog | Index selection, pagination and startup independent of image bytes (later library) |
| At least 1,000 real images, then a larger owner dataset | Thumbnail decode and cache behavior synthetic rows cannot show |
| Local SSD, later removable SSD and NAS | CPU/GPU throughput versus storage latency |
| Nikon Z6 NEF and Fujifilm X100VI RAF in the owner's real modes | Later RAW decode quality and peak memory |

Datasets need provenance, dimensions, profile and orientation, and redistribution permission. Synthetic fixtures live in the repository; private originals stay in a local manifest and are never committed.

## Provisional budgets

Engineering hypotheses until measured and accepted on the recorded M4 configuration, in SDR with the display contract recorded.

| Metric | Proposed budget |
| --- | --- |
| Launch to usable empty shell | p95 < 1 s warm, < 2 s cold |
| Uncached 24 MP JPEG to Fit preview | p95 < 750 ms; loading feedback within 100 ms |
| Crop overlay frame time | p95 ≤ 16.7 ms at 60 Hz |
| Geometry input to presented preview | p95 < 50 ms once the source preview is ready |
| Empty steady-state process memory | ≤ 150 MiB including helper processes |
| 24 MP single-image edit working set | ≤ 600 MiB CPU-resident |
| 60 MP import or export peak | ≤ 1 GiB process RSS, GPU memory reported separately |
| Idle CPU | < 1% of one core over 30 s after background work settles |
| First page of a 100,000-row indexed filter | p95 < 100 ms warm (later library) |
| Warm adjacent-image Fit preview | p95 < 150 ms on a cache hit (later library) |

A single float32 RGBA buffer for 60 MP is about 916 MiB, so unrestricted full-resolution float processing needs tiling before it is promised.

## Recorded baselines

Native M4 Pro, release builds, warm filesystem cache, synthetic fixtures. Diagnostic observations, not accepted budgets or cross-platform claims.

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| S0 viewer launch to observed frame (empty / 24 MP / 60 MP) | median 233 / 296 / 412 ms |
| S0 request to captured frame (24 / 60 MP) | median 237 / 361 ms |
| S0 sampled peak RSS (empty / 24 / 60 MP) | 111 / 506 / 772 MiB; 965 MiB after sixteen 60 MP loads |
| S0 idle CPU after settling | 0.033% of one core over 30 s |
| Core import of a 24 / 60 MP JPEG | 55 / 118 ms |
| Pixel edit after a rotate on 24 MP | 0.2 ms (sampling path) |
| Core one transform on 24 MP after the module registry (p50 / p95, 20 samples) | 12.2 / 13.5 ms; 200 composed transforms 11.4 / 11.9 ms; registration of the built-in modules 0.18 ms and first render after open 0.05 ms on the 480×320 fixture (release acceptance run) |
| Editor RSS after M1/M2 journey with a small fixture | about 101 MiB, 0.2% CPU idle |

With the crop module, `editor-performance` on 24 and 60 MP, 30 samples each, warm cache. The crop
rows render the whole stack: 200 composed exact transforms and then one straightened crop, whose
resample is a stage boundary, so the difference between the two rows is the interpolating pass.

| Measurement | 24 MP | 60 MP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core render of one exact transform (p50 / p95) | 10.7 / 11.2 ms | 22.7 / 26.0 ms |
| Core render of 200 composed exact transforms (p50 / p95) | 10.7 / 11.1 ms | 22.5 / 24.2 ms |
| The same stack with a 10° `crop-fit` on top (p50 / p95) | 33.2 / 37.7 ms | 70.5 / 77.0 ms |
| Crop output stage that measures | 3695 × 2077 from a 4000 × 6000 input | 5542 × 3116 from a 6000 × 10000 input |
| `crop-fit` commit: validation, fitting, compile and persistence, no render | 1.3 ms | 0.9 ms |
| Identity render from the cached decode (shared buffer, no copy) | under 0.01 ms | under 0.01 ms |

Editor process measurements from `measure`, five app-cold launches per workload plus one repeated
60 MP run, on the same host. Launch to observed frame is an upper bound: it includes the harness's
capture readback, not scanout.

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Launch to observed frame (empty / 24 MP / 60 MP) | median 231 / 285 / 396 ms |
| Open request to captured frame (24 / 60 MP) | median 196 / 303 ms, of which upload 27 / 67 ms |
| Sampled peak RSS (empty / 24 / 60 MP) | 124 / 469 / 987 MiB; 1151 MiB after sixteen 60 MP loads |
| Idle CPU with a 60 MP image open, 30 s after settling | 1.03% of one core, RSS flat at 967 MiB |

That last figure sits just above the provisional idle budget. It is one 30-second sample with a
60 MP image open, so the 500 ms event poll and the window's own redraws are included; it is a
measurement to reproduce and attribute, not an accepted regression.

Crop correctness evidence is rendered, not timed: the `crop` and `crop-draft` smoke scenarios record
correlated state, events and pixel checks, and no latency is claimed from them.

Core figures exclude desktop scheduling, GPU upload and presentation. Reproduce with `editor-performance` and `measure` as described in [development](../engineering/development.md).

Current macOS `measure` runs use background-only bundles to preserve desktop focus. Launch-to-frame timings include copying the executable and creating its temporary bundle; they are background renderer measurements, not foreground activation measurements. Reports identify the launch mode. Earlier launch baselines above predate this wrapper and are not directly comparable.

## Method

Optimized builds only, with commit, lockfile, OS, CPU/GPU, RAM, display and storage recorded. Report cold and warm runs separately and say which cold is meant. Keep at least 30 samples and never drop failures or tails silently. Measure user event to presented frame, not shader time, and account CPU RSS, cache bytes, GPU allocations and transient copies without double-counting unified memory. Capture idle after all background work stops. No timing gates in CI; CI enforces exactness, deterministic bounds and coverage. VM checks record hypervisor, guest graphics path and software versus accelerated rendering, and never stand in for native timings.

Correctness checks use deterministic fixtures across all EXIF orientations, gradients, patches and fine detail: coordinate round trips, crop coverage, CPU versus GPU differences and export interpretation, including centered Option resizing and angle sweeps that return without cumulative shrinkage. Color and export proofs choose explicit numerical tolerances and viewing conditions.

## Module activation

Logical boundaries and user enablement do not by themselves reduce memory or launch time. After the first external use case is selected, compare the built-in baseline with an activation prototype on the M4: minimal and default configurations, disabled and enabled-but-unused modules, first use, cold and warm launch, RSS, CPU/GPU allocations, idle work and first-use latency, with packaging size reported separately. Disabled modules must start no workers and allocate no processor resources. Reject any optimization that changes output or skips a recipe effect. If the benefit is immaterial, keep the simpler built-in implementation; the external-loader requirement remains regardless.

## Growth rules

Catalog opening never enumerates or decodes all originals. Grid memory depends on visible items and cache quotas. Import, hashing, thumbnailing and indexing use backpressure and resumable batches. Switching photos cancels obsolete preview requests, and the app stays interactive during exports and indexing. Introduce tiling with neighborhood halos before promising unrestricted large-image local processing. A cleanly reported resource limit is acceptable; silent exhaustion is not.
