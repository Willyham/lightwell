# Performance measurement plan

Status: provisional budgets, not accepted requirements. The owner's M4 MacBook Pro is the reference machine. The engineering rules every core and desktop change must follow are in [performance rules](../engineering/performance-rules.md). Fast interaction, background throughput and output correctness are evaluated separately.

## Reference workloads

| Workload | What it reveals |
| --- | --- |
| 24 MP and 60 MP JPEGs, EXIF-rotated variants, embedded sRGB/Adobe RGB/Display P3 profiles | First-open latency, memory, geometry and color |
| Huge or invalid dimensions, truncated files, malformed profiles | Resource bounds and error recovery |
| M4 with its actual display scale recorded; optional external SDR 4K | Preview, input, color, DPI and Metal resource measurements |
| Linux ARM64 VM, later native Windows/Linux GPU machines | Functional portability versus native GPU behavior, measured separately |
| 100,000 metadata rows; 1,000,000-row stress catalog | Index selection, pagination and startup independent of image bytes (later library) |
| At least 1,000 real images, then a larger owner dataset | Thumbnail decode and cache behavior synthetic rows cannot show |
| Local SSD, later removable SSD and NAS | CPU/GPU throughput versus storage latency |
| Nikon Z6 NEF and Fujifilm X100VI RAF in the owner's real modes | Later RAW decode quality and peak memory |

Datasets need provenance, dimensions, profile and orientation, and redistribution permission. Synthetic fixtures live in the repository; private originals stay in a local manifest and are never committed.

## Provisional budgets

Engineering hypotheses until measured and accepted on the recorded M4 configuration, in SDR with the display contract recorded.

| Metric | Proposed budget |
| --- | --- |
| Launch to usable empty shell | p95 < 1 s warm, < 2 s cold |
| Uncached 24 MP JPEG to Fit preview | p95 < 750 ms; loading feedback within 100 ms |
| Crop overlay frame time | p95 ≤ 16.7 ms at 60 Hz |
| Geometry input to presented preview | p95 < 50 ms once the source preview is ready |
| Empty steady-state process memory | ≤ 150 MiB including helper processes |
| 24 MP single-image edit working set | ≤ 600 MiB CPU-resident |
| 60 MP import or export peak | ≤ 1 GiB process RSS, GPU memory reported separately |
| Idle CPU | < 1% of one core over 30 s after background work settles |
| First page of a 100,000-row indexed filter | p95 < 100 ms warm (later library) |
| Warm adjacent-image Fit preview | p95 < 150 ms on a cache hit (later library) |

A single float32 RGBA buffer for 60 MP is about 916 MiB, so unrestricted full-resolution float processing needs tiling before it is promised.

## Recorded baselines

Native M4 Pro, release builds, warm filesystem cache, synthetic fixtures. Diagnostic observations, not accepted budgets or cross-platform claims.

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| S0 viewer launch to observed frame (empty / 24 MP / 60 MP) | median 233 / 296 / 412 ms |
| S0 request to captured frame (24 / 60 MP) | median 237 / 361 ms |
| S0 sampled peak RSS (empty / 24 / 60 MP) | 111 / 506 / 772 MiB; 965 MiB after sixteen 60 MP loads |
| S0 idle CPU after settling | 0.033% of one core over 30 s |
| Core import of a 24 / 60 MP JPEG | 58 / 126 ms |
| Core one transform on 24 / 60 MP (p50) | 11.7 / 24.6 ms; 200 composed transforms 13.4 / 27.1 ms |
| Pixel edit after a rotate on 24 MP | 0.2 ms (sampling path) |
| Core one transform on 24 MP after the module registry (p50 / p95, 20 samples) | 12.2 / 13.5 ms; 200 composed transforms 11.4 / 11.9 ms; registration of the built-in modules 0.18 ms and first render after open 0.05 ms on the 480×320 fixture (release acceptance run) |
| Editor RSS after M1/M2 journey with a small fixture | about 101 MiB, 0.2% CPU idle |

Core figures exclude desktop scheduling, GPU upload and presentation. Reproduce with `editor-performance` and `measure` as described in [development](../engineering/development.md).

## Method

Optimized builds only, with commit, lockfile, OS, CPU/GPU, RAM, display and storage recorded. Report cold and warm runs separately and say which cold is meant. Keep at least 30 samples and never drop failures or tails silently. Measure user event to presented frame, not shader time, and account CPU RSS, cache bytes, GPU allocations and transient copies without double-counting unified memory. Capture idle after all background work stops. No timing gates in CI; CI enforces exactness, deterministic bounds and coverage. VM checks record hypervisor, guest graphics path and software versus accelerated rendering, and never stand in for native timings.

Correctness checks use deterministic fixtures across all EXIF orientations, gradients, patches and fine detail: coordinate round trips, crop coverage, CPU versus GPU differences and export interpretation, including centered Option resizing and angle sweeps that return without cumulative shrinkage. Color and export proofs choose explicit numerical tolerances and viewing conditions.

## Module activation

Logical boundaries and user enablement do not by themselves reduce memory or launch time. After the first external use case is selected, compare the built-in baseline with an activation prototype on the M4: minimal and default configurations, disabled and enabled-but-unused modules, first use, cold and warm launch, RSS, CPU/GPU allocations, idle work and first-use latency, with packaging size reported separately. Disabled modules must start no workers and allocate no processor resources. Reject any optimization that changes output or skips a recipe effect. If the benefit is immaterial, keep the simpler built-in implementation; the external-loader requirement remains regardless.

## Growth rules

Catalog opening never enumerates or decodes all originals. Grid memory depends on visible items and cache quotas. Import, hashing, thumbnailing and indexing use backpressure and resumable batches. Switching photos cancels obsolete preview requests, and the app stays interactive during exports and indexing. Introduce tiling with neighborhood halos before promising unrestricted large-image local processing. A cleanly reported resource limit is acceptable; silent exhaustion is not.
