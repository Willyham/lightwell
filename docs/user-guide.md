# Lightwell user guide

What works today: opening a JPEG, pixel-proof edits, exact transforms and a Lightroom-style crop and straighten tool, all delivered as tool modules with generated controls, persistent history and the JSON API, verified on macOS. Export, Locate and MCP are planned; see [feature status](features.md).

## Start the editor

After [developer setup](engineering/development.md), start an optimized build with a catalog and an optional JPEG:

```sh
cargo xtask develop --catalog /path/to/catalog.sqlite --open /path/to/photo.jpg
```

Omit `--catalog` to use the platform configuration directory. `--data-root DIRECTORY` isolates config, cache and log paths. `cargo xtask develop --debug` is an unoptimized build for debugging and is unsuitable for timing.

Open references an existing supported sRGB or greyscale JPEG without copying or modifying it. Cmd+O on macOS and Ctrl+O elsewhere opens the picker. EXIF orientation is applied once before any edit. The catalog stores stable identities, the source fingerprint, ordered operations and history. It is not a backup of the original photo.

## Edit and inspect

The tool panel is generated from the registered tool modules: each module declares its fields and buttons, and the desktop only lays them out. A field shows its unit and, while its text is outside the declared range, the message naming that range; a button is enabled only when the current state is editable and every value it needs is valid. Tab and Shift+Tab move between fields, and Enter in a field runs its action. A control kind this build cannot draw is shown as an explicit unsupported-control message rather than hidden, and an unavailable module is listed with its reason.

Pixel proof accepts integer x/y coordinates and RGB values from 0 to 255. Coordinates use the operation's input image with a top-left origin, x right and y down. Clicking the photo at Fit or any zoom fills X and Y with the pixel under the pointer without committing anything. Apply pixel creates one layer and one attributed history action when the resulting pixel changes. Invalid, out-of-bounds and same-value requests add nothing.

Exact transforms are Rotate left, Rotate right, Mirror horizontal and Flip vertical. Quarter-turns swap dimensions. Order is preserved: a pixel edit before a rotation moves with the image, and one made afterwards addresses the rotated dimensions.

Fit shows the whole image. Enter a percentage from 10 to 1600 and choose Set, or choose 100%. On a high-DPI display, 100% maps one source pixel to one physical framebuffer pixel. Both scroll axes pan content larger than the viewport.

### Crop and straighten

The crop editor appears in the tool panel as soon as a registered module declares a crop frame; the ratios, the angle range and the action it commits all come from that module's descriptor.

Choose Crop to open a draft. The surface then shows the crop layer's own input stage, which is the stack rendered up to but not including that layer, so layers after an existing crop are not drawn while you adjust it. Everything outside the crop rectangle is dimmed, and the rectangle carries a thirds overlay, a border and eight handles.

- Drag a corner handle to move two edges, or a side handle to move one with the opposite edge fixed. Drag inside the rectangle to move the composition; it slides along a boundary instead of stopping. The rectangle never leaves the photograph, so a crop never has an empty corner, and it never shrinks below one pixel on either axis.
- Hold Option (Alt on Windows and Linux) while dragging any handle to apply one scale factor about the fixed centre, keeping the current width to height even with no ratio locked. The centre does not move.
- Choose a ratio preset to keep the centre and fit the largest rectangle of that ratio inside the current one. Custom takes the two extents typed beside it. Lock ratio pins whatever the rectangle currently is, Unlock ratio releases it, and Swap inverts a locked ratio the same way.
- Type an angle from −45 to 45 degrees and press Enter, or use the −0.5° and +0.5° buttons. Every angle is measured against the last handle, move or ratio change, so sweeping the angle away and back returns exactly the rectangle you had. Larger rotations are the quarter-turn transforms.
- Turn Straighten guide on and drag a line along something that should be level; releasing rotates by the angle that makes that line horizontal or vertical, whichever is nearer.
- Hold Space and drag to pan at a percentage zoom. Fit, 100% and a typed percentage all work while drafting, and 100% still shows one input pixel per physical pixel.

The panel prints the input stage, the rectangle in whole box pixels, the resulting output size and the exact values the draft would commit.

Apply, or press Enter, commits one action and one new history entry, adjusting the existing crop layer in place and keeping its identity or appending one when there is none. Cancel, or press Escape, discards the draft and changes nothing. Enter and Escape act only when no field has just consumed the key. Reset crop is the module's own control: it commits the neutral crop through history and ends the draft. No pointer movement commits anything, and the rotation shown while drafting is a display filter — the committed render is what counts.

Selecting a historical state pauses the draft rather than discarding it: the historical preview is shown and Return to current resumes drafting. If anything else changes the photograph while a draft is open — another client, or your own Undo, Redo or Restore — the draft is kept and marked "Changed elsewhere". Apply is refused until you choose Discard, which drops the draft, or Reapply, which re-reads the current stack, rebases the draft onto it keeping the angle and the composition as far as it fits, and lets you apply normally.

## History

History lists Original and every committed action with sequence and actor. The filled marker is current; selecting another row previews that immutable snapshot without changing current state or revision. Return to current leaves the preview; Restore appends a new action containing the selected recipe. Editing is disabled during a historical preview.

Versions name the displayed state so you can find it again among many entries. Type a name and choose Save; each version is listed with its entry number, selecting one previews it, and Restore this state brings it back as a new action. Deleting a version removes only the name. History rows marked branch were undone and replaced by later edits; they remain available for preview, restore and versions.

Undo and Redo navigate saved states without appending rows. Cmd+Z / Ctrl+Z and Shift+Cmd+Z / Shift+Ctrl+Z invoke the same service as the buttons. A new edit clears shortcut redo while every older entry remains available for preview or Restore. Layers, history, navigation state and stable IDs survive reopening the catalog.

Missing or changed sources keep their catalog data and report why rendering is unavailable. Incompatible catalogs or operation payloads fail explicitly; Lightwell never silently resets or drops them.

## JSON automation

The headless owner reads one JSON request per line and writes one response per line. Diagnostics stay off stdout:

```sh
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"id":"schema","method":"schema.list","params":{}}' \
  '{"id":"import","method":"catalog.import","params":{"path":"/path/to/photo.jpg"}}' \
  | target/release/lightwell-json --catalog /path/to/catalog.sqlite
```

A request has `id`, `method` and `params`. A success carries the matching `id`, an event `sequence` and `result`; a failure carries a structured `error`. Start with `schema.list` for the authoritative method list and `catalog.list` for the referenced assets. Edit actions are generated from the registered tool modules: `module.list` returns every module with its effects, actions, parameter descriptors (kind, range, unit, default) and semantic controls, and each action `<id>` is callable as `edit.<id>` with its parameters as top-level fields beside `asset_id` and `mutation`. Today that is `edit.set-pixel` (`x`, `y`, `rgb`), `edit.transform` (`transform`) and the crop module's three actions. Parameters are checked against the descriptors before the module sees them, so every client gets the same structured validation error. `version.create`, `version.list`, `version.delete` and `history.lineage` cover named states and the undo-parent chain. Mutations require `asset_id` and a `mutation` object:

```json
{"id":"rotate","method":"edit.transform","params":{"asset_id":"asset-…","mutation":{"expected_revision":0,"request_id":"rotate-1","actor":"my-client"},"transform":"rotate-right"}}
```

`edit.crop-fit` (`aspect`, optional `aspect-width`/`aspect-height` with `aspect: "custom"`, `angle`, optional `center-x`/`center-y`) fits the largest rectangle of a ratio about a center without computing the box geometry by hand:

```json
{"id":"crop-169","method":"edit.crop-fit","params":{"asset_id":"asset-…","mutation":{"expected_revision":3,"request_id":"crop-1","actor":"my-client"},"aspect":"16:9"}}
```

`edit.crop` (`angle`, `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`) sets the straightening angle and rectangle exactly as persisted, normalized to the rotated box:

```json
{"id":"crop-exact","method":"edit.crop","params":{"asset_id":"asset-…","mutation":{"expected_revision":4,"request_id":"crop-2","actor":"my-client"},"angle":0,"x":0.1,"y":0.1,"width":0.8,"height":0.6}}
```

Both actions reject a rectangle that would need an empty corner with a structured `validation` error naming the offending corner, its mapped input coordinates and how far outside the input stage it lands. Every crop request updates the stack's one crop layer in place, keeping its layer ID, or appends one when the stack has none; a request equal to the saved payload is a no-op. `edit.crop-reset` takes no parameters, returns an existing crop layer to the neutral payload (`angle 0, x 0, y 0, width 1, height 1`) and is a no-op without one.

While the desktop owns a catalog it creates `CATALOG.live-session.json` beside it, recording a `127.0.0.1` address and a token. That session accepts the same newline-delimited requests with the token as the request's top-level `token`. The file is owner-readable on Unix and removed on orderly shutdown. Up to eight clients are accepted; requests are limited to 1 MiB and retained events to 256. Use `events.since`, and refresh with `asset.state` if it reports a gap.

A catalog has one owner. Starting the headless command against a catalog open in the GUI fails instead of creating competing state. Request IDs deduplicate retries; reusing one with different input fails.
