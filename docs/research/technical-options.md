# Technical options and evidence

Research context behind the stack choices. Rust and Iced are selected; the alternatives are recorded so the reasoning survives. No comparative benchmarks have been run. Companion research: [Lightroom Classic](lightroom/README.md) and [darktable](darktable/README.md).

## Desktop interface

"Native" means three different things: an OS executable, OS-provided widgets and direct GPU rendering. A native executable with custom GPU-rendered controls satisfies the product direction without three widget implementations. [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) (Rust, MIT, wgpu) was chosen because it keeps the whole application in Rust and shares the GPU abstraction with the image engine; an isolated probe in `probes/s0` showed both Iced and egui rendering correctly on M4 Metal, with no performance winner. That is an architectural judgment, not evidence that Iced beats Qt, Slint, GPUI or a WebView.

Recorded alternatives: [egui/eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui) (immediate mode, used in the probe), [Slint](https://docs.slint.dev/latest/docs/slint/guide/backends-and-renderers/backends_and_renderers/) (declarative; its royalty-free terms differ from the GPL option), [Qt Quick](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html) behind a narrow C++ bridge (the serious fallback if Rust UI cannot deliver the required UX), [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/crates/gpui/README.md) (credible but pre-1.0 and tied to Zed), [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/start/) (WebView; GPU ownership of the photo surface unproven) and [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/desktop) (an extra language and interop boundary). If essential accessibility or display-color behavior cannot be delivered without maintaining a framework fork, reconsider. UI toolkit dependencies stay outside the domain model.

## Rendering

[wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/) provides Metal, Vulkan and DirectX 12 backends for presentation and later processing. Backend support does not imply every GPU supports every format or compute feature: probe capabilities and budget resources. Start with CPU decode and a CPU reference renderer, upload a bounded preview once and transform it on the GPU while dragging. Use the CPU path for correctness comparisons and headless export, with shared coordinate and color definitions and declared tolerances between paths. Do not build a whole GPU image graph for the first crop tool; tiling and pyramids become essential as neighborhood operations grow, and selective invalidation, memory accounting and cancellation matter before exotic kernels.

## Linux VM testing

[Try Omarchy](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy) documents Apple Silicon support with a QEMU/virgl/ANGLE path that translates guest OpenGL through Metal, and [UTM](https://docs.getutm.app/settings-qemu/devices/display/) documents experimental VirGL acceleration. Either is a plausible ARM64 Linux functional-test route, not evidence that the wgpu feature set or native Linux performance works. Record the guest adapter and whether rendering is software or accelerated; use a native Linux GPU machine for renderer validation. No VM has been installed or tested.

## Image processing and RAW

| Component | Proposed role | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [image-rs](https://github.com/image-rs/image) | JPEG decode and encode behind an adapter; PNG later | Not color management or RAW development |
| [Little CMS](https://littlecms.com/color-engine/) | ICC transformations and CPU color reference (MIT) | Does not obtain the monitor profile or define the OS surface color contract |
| [LibRaw](https://www.libraw.org/about) | Preferred RAW decoding trial: pixels, sensor metadata, embedded previews | LGPL-2.1/CDDL-1.0; production rendering is explicitly out of its scope |
| [RawSpeed](https://github.com/darktable-org/rawspeed) | Benchmark alternative when unpacking is a measured bottleneck | Supplies sensor data only; qualify coverage, integration and license |
| [Rawler/DNGLab](https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab) | Rust RAW decoder to investigate if camera support or integration justifies it | LGPL-2.1; supported extensions do not establish rendering quality |
| [libvips](https://www.libvips.org/) | Possible future thumbnail and batch helper | A second image system needs a measured workload first |

LibRaw's [camera list](https://www.libraw.org/supported-cameras) includes the original Nikon Z6 and the Fujifilm X100VI, qualified by build features; its HE/HE* exclusions name other Nikon models, not the owner's Z6. Actual recording modes still need fixtures, and an embedded JPEG is not proof of RAW development.

The owner is open to a new RAW library if existing options fail. Escalation: measure I/O, unpack, demosaic, color and preview upload independently on real Z6 and X100VI files; compare LibRaw, RawSpeed and Rawler at equivalent output stages; fix scheduling or contribute a targeted patch; consider a fork or a narrow new decoder only for a reproducible gap with a latency target and correctness corpus. Age or language alone is not evidence of poor performance. Full RAW support also needs black and white levels, mosaic interpretation including X-Trans demosaic, camera-to-working-space conversion, white balance, highlight handling and a pleasing default rendition; lens corrections and noise reduction are explicit decisions. JPEG temperature is a creative adjustment of rendered pixels, not RAW white balance; familiar slider names do not imply Adobe-identical algorithms.

## Catalog and storage

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html) is the catalog store with indexed metadata, recipes and revisions; originals and disposable previews live outside it. Use short transactions and one application-level writer. [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) needs a local filesystem, so a live catalog inside a network share or cloud-sync folder is not a supported configuration. Use the [backup API](https://www.sqlite.org/backup.html) for consistent snapshots. Million-photo workloads need their own query and I/O measurements.

## Agent and extension interfaces

The command API is the application boundary; MCP is an adapter over it. Operations are JSON-schema described with state queries, bounded previews, structured errors, revision checks and jobs; the UI calls the same service directly. The [MCP tools specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/server/tools) and [stdio transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/basic/transports/stdio) fit a local client-launched process; prefer the [official Rust SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) after verifying its released protocol support. Never introduce a hosted service to serve a desktop app.

External modules: presets and workflow automation are candidate first use cases, not the limit of the API. Capability-limited WebAssembly through [Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security.html) is an isolation option if the use case warrants it, but the host still designs the API and resource limits, and it is not the assumed path for every image kernel. Third-party native binaries or shaders need their own trust and failure-isolation design.

## Reuse versus a new application

[darktable](https://www.darktable.org/about/) and [RawTherapee](https://www.rawtherapee.com/) already combine catalogs, non-destructive processing and floating-point pipelines under GPLv3. Forking would reach sophisticated RAW output sooner at the cost of inheriting a large architecture and still needing a coherent command interface. The recommendation is a new small application on established libraries, with an explicit owner decision if early RAW quality warrants reusing a larger engine. Do not copy GPL implementation into a differently licensed core.

## License

Project code is GPL-3.0-or-later with an open-source extension direction; see [dependencies](../engineering/dependencies.md). A process or WebAssembly boundary is not automatically a licensing exception. Native SDK prerequisites are distinct from redistributed components. Review exact native libraries, decoder packs and assets before distribution; that manual review is currently deferred.
